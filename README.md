# FreeStyleLab (16 Jul 2025 Release) 
## An iOS Dance App for Freestylers  
*A Swift-built mobile toolbox designed to help freestyle dancers train smarter, sharper, and with greater intention for dance battles.*

This app is built as an evolving platform‚Äîa growing toolkit where more features will be added over time to support the diverse needs of freestyle dancers. Currently, three core tools are in development:

---

1. BeatLink:   
Upload two videos‚Äîeither of yourself or you and another dancer‚Äîdancing to the same track. The app uses machine learning to synchronize the audio and play both videos side by side, allowing you to compare timing, movement, and style with precision.

2. BeatCounter:  
Let the app handle your counts. Choose from:
- **Numbers:** `1 N 2 N 3 N 4`
- **Sound Syllables:** `Boom Tsk Ka`
- **Metronome:** `beep beep beep`
  ...across 4, 8, 16, or 32 beats to stay on rhythm while training or choreographing.

3. MotionTracker:   
Upload a video of your favorite dancer. The app will strip away visual clutter and render their movement as a simplified stickman‚Äîhelping you break down body mechanics, rhythm, and transitions with clarity.

## Preview (Coming soon)
Stay tuned!


## Non-Technical Objective

This passion project is a fusion of two things I deeply care about: code and dance. If you browse the App Store for dance-related apps, you‚Äôll find fitness programs, rhythm games like JustDance, or learning platforms like Steezy. But none are designed to serve freestyle dancers ‚Äî especially those training for cyphers, jams, or battles. This app is built specifically for them. 

## Technical Objective

This app also serves as a portfolio project to showcase my capabilities as an iOS developer. It highlights my ability to:

- Design intuitive, user-centric interfaces tailored for niche communities
- Implement real-time audio synchronization using AVFoundation and CoreMedia
- Integrate 3D skeleton tracking with computer vision frameworks such as ARKit
- Build clean, modular, and testable architecture using the MVVM design pattern
- Develop and consume RESTful APIs to support scalable backend integration
- Write unit tests and configure a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated quality checks

##  Features

| Feature                            | Status         | Description |
|------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| üé• **BeatLink**                    | üöß In Progress | Upload two videos dancing to the same track. Uses ML to sync the audio and play them side by side‚Äîperfect for comparing movement, timing, and style. |
| üé∂ **BeatCounter**                 | üöß In Progress | Helps dancers stay on rhythm by counting beats using Numbers (`1 N 2 N`), Sound Syllables (`Boom Tsk Ka`), or Metronome (`beep beep beep`). Works across 4, 8, 16, or 32 counts. |
| üßç **MotionTracker**              | üöß In Progress | Upload a video of a dancer. The app reduces it to a simplified stickman form to help analyze movement mechanics and flow. |
