# FreeStyleLab
## An iOS Dance App For Freestylers 
A Swift-built mobile toolset to help freestyle dancers train smarter, sharper, and more intentionally for dance battles.

## 📸 Preview (Coming soon)
Stay tuned!


## Non-Technical Objective

This passion project is a fusion of two things I deeply care about: code and dance. If you browse the App Store for dance-related apps, you’ll find fitness programs, rhythm games like JustDance, or learning platforms like Steezy. But none are designed to serve freestyle dancers — especially those training for cyphers, jams, or battles. This app is built specifically for them. At its core, the app focuses on two main features:

- Beat Counter – Syncs with platforms like Spotify, YouTube Music, or SoundCloud to help dancers stay on beat while drilling movement.
- 3D Skeletal Tracking & Playback – Uses computer vision to capture full-body movement as a 3D skeleton in real time, allowing dancers to view simplified skeletal motion for clearer study, playback, and technique replication.

## Technical Objective

This app also serves as a portfolio project to showcase my capabilities as an iOS developer. It highlights my ability to:

- Design intuitive, user-centric interfaces tailored for niche communities
- Implement real-time audio synchronization using AVFoundation and CoreMedia
- Integrate 3D skeleton tracking with computer vision frameworks such as ARKit
- Build clean, modular, and testable architecture using the MVVM design pattern
- Develop and consume RESTful APIs to support scalable backend integration
- Write unit tests and configure a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated quality checks

## ✨ Features
