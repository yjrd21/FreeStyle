# FAQ

### Have you explored Spotify, SoundCloud, or YouTube Music integration?

Yes. Iâ€™ve explored all three platforms, but each comes with important limitations:
1. Spotify does not allow third-party apps to stream or play music directly. Playback must occur through the official Spotify app, and only for users with a Premium account. As such, this app does not display or play songs from your Spotify library.
2. SoundCloud only allows streaming of certain public tracks, and those can usually only be played through a built-in web player. This limits how smoothly the app can control or interact with the audio. 
3. YouTube Music only allows songs to be played through the official YouTube player, which means the audio can't be directly accessed or used by this app.


Because of these restrictions, the app currently supports locally uploaded audio files and video files
